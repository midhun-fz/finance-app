## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` - Starts the development server
- `npm run build:web` or `yarn build:web` - Builds the app for web deployment
- `npm run build:ios` or `yarn build:ios` - Generates a production iOS build
- `npm run lint` or `yarn lint` - Runs the linter to check for code issues

### Building for iOS

Use the provided script to generate an iOS build with EAS:

```bash
npm run build:ios
```

This command uploads the project to Expo Application Services and generates an
`.ipa` file you can submit to TestFlight or the App Store. Ensure you have set
up your Apple developer credentials with `eas credentials` before running the
build.

## Development

### Environment Setup

The app uses Expo's default environment configuration. For custom environment variables, you can create a `.env` file (which is already gitignored).

### Adding New Features

When adding new features, please follow the existing component structure and naming conventions:
- Place screens in the appropriate directory under `app/`
- Add reusable components to the `components/` directory
- Update types in the `types/` directory as needed
